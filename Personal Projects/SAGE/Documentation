SAGE Developer
Responsibilities: Develop a web scraper to collect all courses for each major to add to the degree plan for the SAGE AI bot to utilize.
What is SAGE: SAGE, or Student Advising Guidance Engine, is an AI chatbot that was created to assist students who could not find answers from the advisors on campus.
SAGE aims to assist students when advisors are taking too long to respond and they need answers urgently. SAGE allows students to ask questions and receive answers after seconds.
SAGE also assists students with picking which classes to register for when the registration period opens up. This is done by looking at courses that the student
has already taken and using the degree plans that have been issued by the University. SAGE will then produce a schedule of courses that shows the next courses students should take.
